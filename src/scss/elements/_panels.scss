/**
 * PANELS
 *
 * Panels are generic containers. They can be nested within each other, and 
 * they don't have any inherent styling. Styling for panel groups is applied
 * using the mixins in this module. Each mixin defines the layout of a fixed
 * set of panels (e.g., split-panel deals with a single parent, and two 
 * children).
 *
 * All panels should have a class specified by global $o-container-class 
 * variable in the params module.
 */


/**
 * split-panel($split)
 *
 * Panel that has two child containers that split the width at certain 
 * coordinate given by $split argument.
 *
 * Children span the entire height of the parent container, and parent has a 
 * specific height given by the $height argument.
 *
 * The $split-from-right argument can either be yes or no. If splitting is done
 * from right, then the right side panel would be that wide, otherwise the 
 * $split width is given to the left panel.
